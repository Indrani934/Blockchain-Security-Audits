1. **Smart Contracts Audit**:
   - **Smart contracts** are self-executing code deployed on the blockchain. They are critical components that manage transactions and enforce business logic.
   - During the audit, review the smart contract code for:
     - **Logic Bugs**: Analyze the contract's logic to ensure it behaves as intended.
     - **Reentrancy Issues**: Check for potential reentrancy attacks where external contracts can manipulate the contract state.
     - **Integer Overflows/Underflows**: Verify that arithmetic operations won't lead to unexpected results.
     - **Access Control**: Ensure proper access control mechanisms are in place.
     - **Input Validation**: Validate input data to prevent unexpected behavior.
     - **Gas Optimization**: Optimize gas usage to reduce costs.
   - Tools like **MythX** and **Slither** can help automate some of these checks.

2. **Consensus Mechanisms Audit**:
   - The consensus mechanism ensures agreement among nodes in the network. Common mechanisms include **Proof of Work (PoW)** and **Proof of Stake (PoS)**.
   - Review the consensus protocol for any vulnerabilities:
     - **Consensus Attacks**: Assess potential attacks against the consensus mechanism itself.
     - **Consensus Delay Attacks**: These can slow down consensus, affecting network performance¹.

3. **Network Infrastructure Audit**:
   - Examine the underlying infrastructure:
     - **Node Security**: Ensure nodes are secure and properly configured.
     - **Network Communication**: Verify secure communication channels.
     - **Key Management**: Assess key storage and management practices.
     - **Firewalls and Access Control**: Protect against unauthorized access.
     - **DDoS Mitigation**: Plan for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

4. **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**:
   - While there's no comprehensive public list of blockchain-specific weaknesses, consider using the **CWE database** as a baseline for known security flaws.
   - Encourage the inclusion of blockchain-specific vulnerabilities in public databases to improve automated detection tools¹.
